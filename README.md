# Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for arithmetics

## Introduction

This project serves as a playground to find out whether it is possible to calculate complex arithmetic expressions using GNNs.

The currently ubiquitous LLMs often have problems with generalizability for these kind of problems, because they lack proper 
parametrization of arithmetics and don't seem to be able to derive an "understanding" of the root problem to be solved.

I have the intuition to be able to train this ability, where the currently ubiquitous LLMs often have problems with generalizability, 
through the more flexible parameterization in graph structures.
